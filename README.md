Extract data set (sp500_stocks.csv) from "Working Data Set - V960.zip
Due to github's size constraints, I cannot simply upload it.
Other versions of the datasets were not uploaded for this reason.

Ensure the followingn libraries are installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels arch scikit-learn scipy cython tslearn requests lxml yfinance

Otherwise follow along main.1.1.ipynb mostly.
Additional code can be provided upon request however, it is currently a mess.
